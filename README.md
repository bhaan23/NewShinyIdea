## Install and Setup

## No trust from Windows

We do not own a certificate to sign the application. This means that when you first download the setup .exe you will get a message saying that the app is not trusted. To bypass this simply click "More info" -> "Run anyway" and you will not see this warning again.

## How it runs

Currently the app runs with [Electron](https://electronjs.org) which lets us convert a web application to a runnable .exe

## Help us out

If you would like to assist in the development you are certainly welcome. To setup the project make sure you have npm installed. Then in the root of the directory just run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm build
npm start
```

- https://github.com/viktorgullmark for developing a great app in [Exilence](https://github.com/viktorgullmark/exilence). It is also built on Electron and it made things so much easier having something to go off of for all of the odd problems we ran into while in development
- GGG for making a fantastic game and allowing users to develop tools around it to help the community
