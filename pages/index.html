		<h1>What is this thing?</h1>
		<p>
			Hi, welcome to Path Of Progression. This is a third party tool for the game Path of Exile used to track character progression through the leveling process. This tool can track many different things, however the most useful in my opinion is where to go next while leveling through the acts. This solves the problem of wondering where to go next, if you forgot a skill point quest, or looking up where to snag that gem you need to link to arc.
			<br>
			Below are three options to get started:
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Create your own:
					<br>
					This will bring you to a blank template where you can start from scratch and input the things you want to track. You can also edit a template from there as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Help me I'm new:
					<br>
					This is a template based off of EngineeringEternity's leveling guide that released just before patch 3.5 which is a great starter's guide to leveling through the acts.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gotta go fast:
					<br>
					This is a template based off of DeadAndDoom's speed run to killing Kitava. Useful for those either looking to get into speed running, those looking to improve their leveling times, or speed running carefully planning out the next record breaking run.
				</li>
			</ol>
